## Quick review of things we should know...  
- Python datatypes  
- Python operators  
- Control Structure Logic  
- How and why are these relevant?  
- Some functions we now know  
	+ print  
	+ type  


## What are loops?  
- Loops are - loops! Synonyms may include cycles.  
- Repeated actions that continue till a condition stops them  


## While loops  
- Very similar to English language.
```python
i = 1
while i < 10:
	print(i) 
	i = i + 1  
```

## While loops  
- When making while loops rememnber to increment your counter!  
- Else you may end up with a loop that never ends!!!   
- Infinite loops are a bad thing.  

## Iterables  
- Anything that you can iterate over is an iterable  
- Examples  
	+ Lists  
	+ Tuples  
	+ Sets  
	+ Dictionaries  
	+ Others...  
		+ range(1, 10)  
- Usually you can find how many items are in an iterable using the `len` function even if you cant index them  
	+ Sets  
	+ range()   

## range() and len()  
- range() takes 1, 2 or 3 **arguments**  
- Function arguments are what are passed into a function  
- If only one argument it is assumed to be from 0 to that argument  
	+ range(10) implies range(0, 10, 1) and will return => **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**  
- If two arguments its is assumed to be start and stop  
	+ range(0, 7) implies range(0, 7, 1) and will return => **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**  
- If three arguments then it is assumed to be start, stop and step  
	+ range(0, 10, 2) is a full and will return => **0, 2, 4, 6, 8**

## For loops  
- These are used when dealing with iterables  
```python
for item in items:
	'do something with item'
```

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'pineapple', 'banana', 'guava']
for fruit in fruits:
	print(fruit)
```

## For loops showing indexes - The enumerate() function   
- Sometimes you want to see not just the items in a collection but ther indexes too.  
- Remember when you were asked to enumerate in an exam or test in school? it simply meant number your answers.  
- The same principle can be used in python. Another reason python is mostly English language.  

```python 
for i, item in enumerate(items): 
	print(i, item)
```

```python
days = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']
for day in days:
	print(day)

for i, day in enumerate(days):
	print(i)
	#print(f"This is day {i}") or
	#print(f"This is day{(i+1)}")

for i, day in enumerate(days):
	print(i, day)
	#print(f"{day} is listed as number {(i+1)} in the week")

```
## For loops with dictionaries (key, value pairs) - The .items() method  
- Remember dictionaries are not indexed by numbers counting from 0  
- Dictionaries are indexed by keys  
- example:

```python
details  = {'name': 'Trevor Donald', 'location': 'Eldorado', 'age': 32}

print(details['name'])
print(details['age'])

for info in details:
	print(info)

for key, value in details.items():
	print(key)
	#print(value)
	#print(f"His {key} is {value}")
```
