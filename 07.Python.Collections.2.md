## Objectives  
- Understand collections even better  
- Understand comprehensions  
- Understand the concepts of map, filter, and reduce  
- Understand lambda functions  

## Review of what we have learnt so far and map to data science  
- Data types  
	+ Numeric  
	+ Categorical  
- Logic - conditions  
- Loops - iterations  
- Data  
	+ Obserevations -> Rows  
	+ Variables -> Columns  
	+ See Excel   	

## Review of collections  
- Lists: 0 indexed defined by \[\], can contain duplicate values, not necessarily sorted, can be modified    
- Tuples: 0 indexed, defined by (), can contain duplicates, not necessarily sorted, can not be modified  
- Dictionaries: key: value pairs, defined by {}, can not contain duplicate keys but may contain duplicate values, not sorted, can be modified    
- Sets: not indexed, but iterable, unique, sorted, can be modified     

## Lambda functions  
- Understanding functions - borrwoing from the mathematical concept of functions  
- Anonymous functions  
- Nameless functions  
- Written in single line  
- Does not use the `return` key word 

```python
lambda x: x
foo = lambda x, y: x + y 
print(foo(1, 2)) 
```
## Map, Filter, Reduce  
- Map 
	+ Apply some function to every member of a collection or iterable   
- Filter  
	+ Filtering members of a collection or iterable to only return those that match with a Boolean True  
- Reduce  
	+ Iteratively applying a function to members of a collection and carrying this forward till a single return value is realized  

## Comprehensions  
- Let's start with English. Assuming we have a box of chocolates we may say   
	+ Give me chocolate for every chocolate you pull out of the box  
	+ chocolate for chocolate in box  
	+ [chocolate for chocolate in box]  
- Comprehension done!  
```python
box = ['red m&m', 'blue m&m', 'yellow m&m', 'green m&m', 'green m&m', 'red m&m', 'green m&m', 'yellow m&m', 'yellow m&m'] 
print([choc for choc in box])
```

## Comprehension -> Mapping  
- We may take this further by saying  
	+ Unwrap chocolate for each chocolate you pull out of the box  
	+ Unwrap chocolate for chocolate in box  
	+ [unwrap(chocolate) for chocolate in box]  
	+ ["unwrap "+ chocolate for chocolate in box]  
	+ [f"unwrap {chocolate}" for chocolate in box]   

```python

unwrapped = [f"unwrap {chocolate}" for chocolate in box]
#unwrapped = {f"unwrap {chocolate}" for chocolate in box}

print(unwrapped)
```

## Comprehension -> Filtering  
- Lets try filtering  
	+ Give me the red chocolates in the box  
	+ I want red chocolates for each chocolate you pull out of the box  
	+ chocolate for chocolate in box if red 
	+ [chocolate for chocolate in box if chocolate == 'red m&m']

```python
reds = [chocolate for chocolate in box if chocolate == 'red m&m']
print(reds) 

unwraped_reds = [f"unwrap {chocolate}" for chocolate in box if chocolate == 'red m&m'] 

```

## Comprehension -> Reduce  
- Lets try getting a single value from a comprehension  
	+ sum all the scores in the class 
	+ sum([score for score in scores]) 
	+ min([score for score in scores])  
	+ max([score for score in scores])  
- More useful with iterables that cannot be indexed  
```python 
scores = (34, 28, 77, 90, 65, 44, 58, 100)
print(sum([score for score in scores]))
print(min([score for score in scores]))
print(max([score for score in scores]))
```
