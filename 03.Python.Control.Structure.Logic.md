## Outline  
- Review of Data Types and Operators  
- Mapping data types  
- Learning Objectives
- Understanding logic in programing  
- The if statement  
- The else statement  
- The elif construct  
- The ternary  
- Review of objectives 
- Gist of the day  


## Review  
- Data Types  
	+ Strings  
	+ Integers  
	+ Floats  
	+ Booleans  
	+ None  
	+ (Collections)  
- Operators  
	+ Assignment (=)  
	+ Mathematical (+, -, /, \*, \*\*, %)  
	+ Concatenation (+)  
	+ Comparison (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=,is, is not, in, not in)  
	+ Logical (and, or)  


##  How Python data types map to data types in Data Science  
- Quantitative (Numeric)  
	+ Integers  
	+ Floats   
- Qualitative  
	+ Strings  
	+ Booleans  
- Missing  
	+ None  


## Learning Objectives  
- Understand comparisons and logic  
- Understand if - else constructs  
- Understand the multiple option constructs  
- Understand the elegant ternary operator  


## Understanding logic in programing  
- Logic in programing is all about Booleans and taking decisions based on truth  
- Check **if** something is **True** then do something 
- The **else** checks what to do when all else is not **True**  
- With Control Structure Logic we are always looking to see if something is True  


## The if statement  
- Respects white space  
```python

if True: "Do something" 

 ```  

```python 

i = 1 
j = 1 
x = 2 
y = 3 
firstname = 'Tchala'  
nation = 'Wakanda'  
alias = 'Black Panther' 
avengers = ["Captain America", "Iron Man", "Hulk", "Thor"]

if x == y: print("Same!")

```

- For more complex situations where more than one line of action is required then:  
```python

if True:
	"do something" 
	"do something else" 
	"do yet another"

```

```python
if firsname == 'Tchala':
	print("It is Tchala") 
	print(f"I think he is from {country}")
	print(f"He is the {alias}!")
```


## The else statement  
- The construct is similar to the if construct in respecting white space  

```python

if True: 
	"do something"
else:
	"do somehting else"

```

```python
if x == y:
	print("They are the same")
else:
	print("They are different")
```


## The elif construct  
- Where there are more than 2 conditions under test then we need to use the else is abbreviated as elif construct 

```python

if True:
	"do something"
elif:
	"do something else" 
elif: 
	"do yet another thing"
else:
	"do nothing"

```

```python
if firstname == 'Steve':
	print(f"Wow its {avengers[0]}")
elif firstname == 'Tony':
	print(f"Wow its the {avengers[1]}") 
elif firstname == 'Bruce':
	print(f"Wow its the {avengers[2]}") 
else:
	print("I don't know if he is an avenger")
```

- The control structure evaluates in sequence and stops where it finds Truth if not it continues to till it gets to the else block and evaluates the else block



## The ternary  
- This is where python becomes really elegant!  
- simple if-else statements in a single line  

```python 
'do something' if True else 'do something else'
```

```python
print("I am from Wakanda!") if firstname == 'Tchala' else print("I am from Asgaard!")
```
